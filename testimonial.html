                                <p>Rose was a wonderful planner. She was calm but also excited, loving, and very engaged during the ceremony. She made us and our guests at ease and really helped us create the perfect evening. We met with her a variety of times prior to our wedding day, where she spent quality time getting to know us both individually and our relationship so that she could incorporate this knowledge into the ceremony. We loved how she gave us the structure but also the freedom to create the type of ceremony we desired. We would definitely recommend Rose! — Rachel & Dean"</p>

                                <p>"Rose was absolutely amazing, and paid a very key role in the design of our wedding ceremony. We had a mixed cultural, secular ceremony (Indian and Canadian), and she worked very hard with us to personalize it. I had many guests come up after and say it was the best wedding ceremony they have ever been to, and everyone was impressed with Rose. I would 100% recommend Rose to anyone looking to have a personalized ceremony. — Meg & Jade"</p>

                                <p>"Rose was recommended to us by our venue and since we knew we were going to have a nontraditional wedding, we were fine with using someone we hadn’t found ourselves. We couldn’t have been more thrilled with Rose. She has a warm, friendly, and open demeanor that translated into the ceremony. Our wedding was casual but meaningful. It involved some audience participation and a lot of spontaneity on behalf of myself, my groom, and the small wedding party. Rose was instrumental in creating a ceremony that was open, fun, relaxing, and full of love. I wish I could go back and do it all over again! "</p>

                                <p>"Rose was our officiant at our at-home wedding. Simply put she was wonderful! She helped guide us through the somewhat daunting task of writing our vows and putting together our ceremony. She met with us several times and really got to know us and what we wanted for our wedding. She then set the tone at the ceremony perfectly to match our desires and reacted with us, our speakers and our guests so that everyone felt included and a part of our ceremony. We had so many wonderful comments from our guests about her. We would highly recommend Rose. Thank you for making our day so very special! —John & Andrea"</p>
